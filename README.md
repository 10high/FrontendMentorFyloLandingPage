### What I learned / Continued Development
First off, I consider this to be my first "real" challenge: A somewhat sophisticated layout that is closer to being a "real" page. I feel that my solution is too "hacky", relying too much on margins and padding to achieve a perfect match against the original.

While I'm happy with the result that you see on screen, I'm unhappy with the underlying "code". I think there could have been a much simpler and cleaner way to achieve the same result.

The main thing I learned/realized during the process is that I need to do much more forward-planning, now that these challenges are becoming larger and more complex. I think I also need to see the Figma design so that I can work out the dimensions in advance, rather than spending so much time comparing on screen against the screenshot with the PerfectPixel Chrome Plugin. I hope that this will also allow me to identify underlying structures present in the page and help me choose a clean solution in advance, rather than "making it up as I go along".

I also learned during the process that my approach to using selectors was a poor choice. While it felt good to be "programming" with adjactent selectors and pseudo classes, like I was hacking the mainframe, I should have been using semantic class names. I did my best to comment the styling as clearly as possible, but I would feel sorry for anyone who would have to come in after me and untangle my script. :) 

The responsiveness, adjusting the window size down or up from the mobile version to the destop version, is passable, but far from professional.

Things that I am happy about include that I felt much more confident in general using flexbox and grids. Achieving the styling I wanted in a situation came much more naturally and with a lot less head-scratching than in the past. I also felt much more natural using semantic HTMl tags.

I was quite pleased with myself that I managed to work out how to invert the Logo's color with: ```filter: brightness(0) saturate(100%) invert(100%);``` I checked someone else's solution and they had simply modified the image.

I was also interest to learn about Awesome Fonts for the social media icons, but I didn't quite manage to get the borders to match perfectly, so I feel I'm missing a trick there.

And while I'm feeling more confident with flexbox and grid, I know that I'm currently using their simplest features and that they can be much more powerful. For the future, I need to begin unlocking more of their "secrets" so I can avoid hacky messes like this solution! :)
